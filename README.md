# shadowsocks-libev

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev) [![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev)

## Intro

[Shadowsocks-libev](https://shadowsocks.org) is a lightweight secured SOCKS5
proxy for embedded devices and low-end boxes.

It is a port of [Shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks)
created by [@clowwindy](https://github.com/clowwindy), and maintained by
[@madeye](https://github.com/madeye) and [@linusyang](https://github.com/linusyang).

Current version: 3.3.2 | [Changelog](debian/changelog)

## Features

Shadowsocks-libev is written in pure C and depends on [libev](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html). It's designed
to be a lightweight implementation of shadowsocks protocol, in order to keep the resource usage as low as possible.

For a full list of feature comparison between different versions of shadowsocks,

```

### Fedora & RHEL

Supported distributions:

* Recent Fedora versions (until EOL)
* RHEL 6, 7 and derivatives (including CentOS, Scientific Linux)

#### Build from source with centos

If you are using CentOS 7, you need to install these prequirement to build from source code:

```bash
yum install epel-release -y
yum install gcc gettext autoconf libtool automake make pcre-devel asciidoc xmlto c-ares-devel libev-devel libsodium-devel mbedtls-devel -y
```

#### Install from repository

Enable repo via `dnf`:

```
su -c 'dnf copr enable librehat/shadowsocks'
```

Or download yum repo on [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/librehat/shadowsocks/) and put it inside `/etc/yum.repos.d/`. The release `Epel` is for RHEL and its derivatives.

Then, install `shadowsocks-libev` via `dnf`:

```bash
su -c 'dnf update'
su -c 'dnf install shadowsocks-libev'
```

or `yum`:

```bash
su -c 'yum update'
su -c 'yum install shadowsocks-libev'
```
The repository is maintained by [@librehat](https://github.com/librehat), any issues, please report [here](https://github.com/librehat/shadowsocks-libev/issues)

### Archlinux & Manjaro

```bash
sudo pacman -S shadowsocks-libev
```

Please refer to downstream [PKGBUILD](https://projects.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk?h=packages/shadowsocks-libev)
script for extra modifications and distribution-specific bugs.

### NixOS

```bash
nix-env -iA nixos.shadowsocks-libev
```

### Nix

```bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.shadowsocks-libev
```

### Linux

In general, you need the following build dependencies:

* autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
* gettext
* pkg-config
* libmbedtls
* libsodium
* libpcre3 (old pcre library)
* libev
* libc-ares
* asciidoc (for documentation only)
* xmlto (for documentation only)

Notes: Fedora 26  libsodium version >= 1.0.12, so you can install via dnf install libsodium instead build from source.

If your system is too old to provide libmbedtls and libsodium (later than **v1.0.8**), you will need to either install those libraries manually or upgrade your system.

If your system provides with those libraries, you **should not** install them from source. You should jump this section and install them from distribution repository instead.

For some of the distributions, you might install build dependencies like this:

```bash
# Installation of basic build dependencies
## Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gettext build-essential autoconf libtool libpcre3-dev asciidoc xmlto libev-dev libc-ares-dev automake libmbedtls-dev libsodium-dev
## CentOS / Fedora / RHEL
sudo yum install gettext gcc autoconf libtool automake make asciidoc xmlto c-ares-devel libev-devel
## Arch
sudo pacman -S gettext gcc autoconf libtool automake make asciidoc xmlto c-ares libev

# Installation of libsodium
export LIBSODIUM_VER=1.0.16
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-$LIBSODIUM_VER.tar.gz
tar xvf libsodium-$LIBSODIUM_VER.tar.gz
pushd libsodium-$LIBSODIUM_VER
./configure --prefix=/usr && make
sudo make install
popd
sudo ldconfig

# Installation of MbedTLS
export MBEDTLS_VER=2.6.0
wget https://tls.mbed.org/download/mbedtls-$MBEDTLS_VER-gpl.tgz
tar xvf mbedtls-$MBEDTLS_VER-gpl.tgz
pushd mbedtls-$MBEDTLS_VER
make SHARED=1 CFLAGS="-O2 -fPIC"
sudo make DESTDIR=/usr install
popd
sudo ldconfig

# Start building
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
sudo make install
```

You may need to manually install missing softwares.

### FreeBSD

```bash
su
cd /usr/ports/net/shadowsocks-libev
make install
```

Edit your config.json file. By default, it's located in /usr/local/etc/shadowsocks-libev.

To enable shadowsocks-libev, add the following rc variable to your /etc/rc.conf file:

```
shadowsocks_libev_enable="YES"
```

Start the Shadowsocks server:

```bash
service shadowsocks_libev start
```

### OpenWRT

The OpenWRT project is maintained here:
[openwrt-shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/openwrt-shadowsocks).

### OS X
For OS X, use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install or build.

Install Homebrew:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
Install shadowsocks-libev:

```bash
brew install shadowsocks-libev
```

### Windows (MinGW)
To build Windows native binaries, the recommended method is to use Docker:

* On Windows: double-click `make.bat` in `docker\mingw`
* On Unix-like system:

        cd shadowsocks-libev/docker/mingw
        make

A tarball with 32-bit and 64-bit binaries will be generated in the same directory.

You could also manually use MinGW-w64 compilers to build in Unix-like shell (MSYS2/Cygwin), or cross-compile on Unix-like systems (Linux/MacOS). Please refer to build scripts in `docker/mingw`.

Currently you need to use a patched libev library for MinGW:

* https://github.com/shadowsocks/libev/archive/mingw.zip

Notice that TCP Fast Open (TFO) is only available on **Windows 10**, **1607** or later version (precisely, build >= 14393). If you are using **1709** (build 16299) or later version, you also need to run the following command in PowerShell/Command Prompt **as Administrator** and **reboot** to use TFO properly:

        netsh int tcp set global fastopenfallback=disabled

### Docker

As you expect, simply pull the image and run.
```
docker pull shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev
docker run -e PASSWORD=<password> -p<server-port>:8388 -p<server-port>:8388/udp -d shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev
```

More information about the image can be found [here](docker/alpine/README.md).

## Transparent proxy

The latest shadowsocks-libev has provided a *redir* mode. You can configure your Linux-based box or router to proxy all TCP traffic transparently, which is handy if you use an OpenWRT-powered router.

    # Create new chain
    iptables -t nat -N SHADOWSOCKS
    iptables -t mangle -N SHADOWSOCKS

    # Ignore your shadowsocks server's addresses
    # It's very IMPORTANT, just be careful.
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 123.123.123.123 -j RETURN

    # Ignore LANs and any other addresses you'd like to bypass the proxy
    # See Wikipedia and RFC5735 for full list of reserved networks.
    # See ashi009/bestroutetb for a highly optimized CHN route list.
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 0.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 169.254.0.0/16 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 172.16.0.0/12 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 224.0.0.0/4 -j RETURN
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -d 240.0.0.0/4 -j RETURN

    # Anything else should be redirected to shadowsocks's local port
    iptables -t nat -A SHADOWSOCKS -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345

    # Add any UDP rules
    ip route add local default dev lo table 100
    ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
    iptables -t mangle -A SHADOWSOCKS -p udp --dport 53 -j TPROXY --on-port 12345 --tproxy-mark 0x01/0x01

    # Apply the rules
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j SHADOWSOCKS
    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j SHADOWSOCKS

    # Start the shadowsocks-redir
    ss-redir -u -c /etc/config/shadowsocks.json -f /var/run/shadowsocks.pid


## Security Tips

For any public server, to avoid users accessing localhost of your server, please add `--acl acl/server_block_local.acl` to the command line.

Although shadowsocks-libev can handle thousands of concurrent connections nicely, we still recommend
setting up your server's firewall rules to limit connections from each user:

    # Up to 32 connections are enough for normal usage
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport ${SHADOWSOCKS_PORT} -m connlimit --connlimit-above 32 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
